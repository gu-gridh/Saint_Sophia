# Inscriptions of Saint Sophia -- backend

This is the repository for the Django application of the Saint Sophia's Inscriptions project, led by Gunnar Almevik and Jonathan Westin at University of Gothenburg. The backend is developed as an initial clone of the [Diana database coordination solution](https://github.com/gu-gridh/diana-backend), developed by GRIDH. The project frontend is developed as a part of the Multimodal Map project, a repository of user interface modules developed by GRIDH specifically aimed at spatio-temporal visualisations.

## Database and API documentation

The backend solution upon which the Saint Sophia's Inscriptions portal is developed allows for consistent data input, and facilitates the interaction of end-users with the data shown in the frontend. To make the data open and reusable, Inscriptions of Saint Sophia makes available compliant REST APIs (including GeoJSON API), generated through the Django REST framework. These are the same APIs the projects's own frontend relies upon. Below follows a description of the APIs. [under construction]
